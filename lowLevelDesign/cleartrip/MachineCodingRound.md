# Round - Machine Coding  - Configurable Logging Platform - Java Console Application

## Duration - 90 mins

1. Configure Logging - ERROR >> WARNING >> INFO >> DEBUG

2. Applications - Console, Network, File [can be changed in the runtime]

3. Unit Tests - JUnit

4. Methods - WriteLog(), setLevel(), addPlatform(), removePlatform()

5. Bonus - Asynchronously save network logs, don't block the logs until completion.



## Requirements 

- The logging framework should support different log levels, such as INFO, DEBUG, WARN, and ERROR.
- It should allow logging messages with a timestamp, log level, and message content.
- The framework should support multiple output destinations, such as console, file, network, and database.
- It should provide a configuration mechanism to set the log level and output destination.
- The logging framework should be thread-safe to handle concurrent logging from multiple threads.
- It should be extensible to accommodate new log levels and output destinations in the future.
